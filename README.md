# code-challenges

In this repo I'm writing the code challenges I'm doing in my free time to practice my coding skills. The goal is to do at least one challenge per week. For now the supported languages are:

- Python
- TypeScript

The goal is to use platforms where I can get the runtime and memory limits of the average and try to be at the top 5%. For now I can check the values manually but I guess I could try to get the values and set tests to check if I beat the times.
