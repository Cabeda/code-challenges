#### Day 1

- Two months ago, Urgon Wenth returned home after exploring Eiselcross for a year. He had been back for only for a few days when he came down with a strange affliction, which made the dwarf move slowly and caused blue veins to appear all over his body.
- The village’s priests of Moradin and Corellon used every spell they could muster to attempt to heal Urgon, but nothing they tried could stop the bizarre malady. Urgon battled the affliction for weeks until his ever-slowing body eventually turned to ice.
- Until yesterday, Elro and the rest of the community believed that Urgon’s sad fate was an isolated incident, most likely caused by something the dwarf came into contact with while exploring Eiselcross. Then Elro noticed Tulgi Lutan, a dwarf trapper, showing signs of the same illness.
- Alarmed, Elro tried to talk to Tulgi about it, but she pushed him away, asking that he let her die in peace.
- Investigation in the cabin started with the correct ideas, terrible rolls
- Found the receipt with a second investigation on the books, Nat20
- At Pelc’s shop, they were not stealthy even though they noticed that someone was in the shop
- Combat starts, and enemies have ready actions for arrows
- No casualties, two prisoners.
- Information
- Hulil Lutan works for the Uttolot family of Shaddycreek Run.
- Hulil’s sister, Tulgi Lutan, robbed Pelc’s Curiosities two months ago.
- Hulil Lutan is sick or cursed with some affliction that causes her to move slowly and is turning her veins blue.
- Hulil ordered the bandits to trash Pelc’s Curiosities in search of potions, scrolls, or other items that might help cure her. Despite their thorough search, the bandits found nothing useful. Hulil is hiding out with more bandits in a cave north.
- Rest Jolly Dwarf. Nothing special, some arm wrestling with Sailors (+3 Athletics). Lots of stories about Urgon Wenth.

#### Day 2

- Visit to Tulgi Cabin, decided to knock and talk. Resolved everything without fighting
- Information
- Tulgi came to Palebank Village a few years back from Shadycreek Run with her sister, **[Hulil](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/744316-hulil-lutan)**. Both work for the Uttolot family.
- The Uttolots sent the sisters and a few others to the village to keep an eye on treasures coming back from Eiselcross—with the intent of stealing them. When such artifacts come through the small settlement, they are often unusual goods that treasure hunters are trying to keep away from Uthodurn or the Dwendalian Empire.
- When Urgon Wenth returned to Palebank Village with treasures from Eiselcross, Tulgi saw her chance. She waited for Urgon to sell his finds to Pelc’s Curiosities, then stole them all.
- Tulgi gave most of Urgon’s relics to Hulil, but kept one for herself—an ornate dagger. She grudgingly gives this weapon to the characters if asked (see “Treasure” below). Hulil has the other items in a site north of the village known as Croaker Cave.
- Tulgi was the one who searched Urgon’s cabin, convinced that the dead dwarf must have had magic or other secrets stored away there.

- Information
- Hulil believes she has a disease called Frigid Woe. Though she doesn’t know any more about the disease than its symptoms, she’s heard rumours that explorers in Eiselcross sometimes succumb to it.
- Hulil has guessed that her affliction was caused by one of the blue vials Tulgi stole from Pelc’s Curiosities, originally sold by Urgon Wenth. The vial was cracked, revealing that its lovely colour was the result of dark blue dust clinging to the interior.
- She is desperate to get to Shadycreek Run before the malady runs its course, hoping that she can trade the goods stolen by Tulgi for a cure.
- Hulil used one of the vials to trap the chest containing the other stolen items. Needing quick cash for the trip, she sold the other vial to Irven Liel, a human merchant staying at the Jolly Dwarf Inn in Palebank Village while travelling with his family to Uthodurn.
- In Jolly Dwarf they talk to Arl Bortock (bartender) and meet Irven Liel (merchant) and his family
- Booksellers, sell 2 history books to Skoot.
- The family is taken to Elro for safekeeping, they announce that they have the second vial and will keep it. Give the broken one to Elro. He will cast Legend Lore through the night.
- At the Jolly Dwarf they learn more about the icebreaker ships, including the biggest. Midnight Hammer left two days ago with a group of adventurers and Vess DeRogna.
- Morning comes and Elro explains Frigid Woe. Irven Liel and his family are all infected and the cure is in the ruins in Eiselcross where Urgon Wenth found the vials. Asks the party to travel there. Payment, 250 gp and a house (maybe?)
- Information
- Elro has arranged passage to Eiselcross for the characters on the *Remorhaz*, a sailing ship owned and operated by the Glassblades.
- The characters will be taken to Syrinlya, an Uthodurnian outpost on Foren, Eiselcross’s largest island. Once there, they should talk to a dwarf named Orvo Mustave, who has gone on numerous expeditions into the wilds of Eiselcross with Urgon Wenth.
- Once the characters have found the cure, they should use whatever they need for themselves, then give the rest to an elf in Syrinlya who goes by the name “the Buyer.” They can tell the Buyer to teleport the cure to Elro Aldataur in Palebank Village.
- Level up to Level 2! And let the travel begin!

### Luis notes 5

Players at Level 2

- Skoot dream - imaginary friend

When you were younger, you had an imaginary friend, a young girl with light blue skin and white hair, whom you played with from time to time. As you grew older, she stopped appearing. You assumed you had just grown out of imaginary friends, but after further consideration, you think the young girl may have been sent by Sehanine, the Moonweaver, or may have been the Moonweaver herself.

- Kive dream - There is nothing worse than the feeling of being watched, and observed. Being hunted not the hunter.

You feel your powers, but never thought of it, why can you heal, where do your spells come from, what is your goal?

- Kraken dream - Piercing eyes in the water, a flash of gold

You heard a voice rumbling around you. You looked down below the water, and for a split second, you saw mournful golden eyes looking up at you asking for help.

- Tarin dream - You have to return it to Jigow

You remember the missionary documents, all of what you learned from Jigow and the Beacon, you can’t explain but it would be a good deed to return it, keep it safe. You know they will have answers for you

Recap do Luís da história.

Vamos para a cerimónia à noite. Vemos o kass, um ogre e outro Drow. São os líderes de jigow.

Somos convidados para participar na corrida da esmeralda.

Somos levados para as black islands

Temos de encontrar uma esmeralda na gruta das black islands. Preso a um tubarão 🦈

Começamos em primeiro.

Ganhamos a corrida. Quase morre o skoot pelo tubarão.

No final da ruína o tarinn encontra e pega num colar. O colar mostra figura de um homem de dourado a pedir para ser libertado pois está preso.

O chão desaparece e caímos. Vamos parar a um sítio todo preto.

Aparece um ponto vermelho que é de ruidus. A luz vermelha aparece por tras do homem dourado. o homem olha para cima, para uma luz branca. Ele pede à deusa da lua que envie alguém que o salve. Que os envie para o sítio onde lhe rezou pela primeira vez. Ele chama-se alyxian. Levem o medalhão para um templo negro

Está perdido na escuridão. Rezou à deusa da mudança. Pede para lhe levarem o amuleto ao coração de um templo negro.

Acordamos com os moonlancers, equipa adversária à nossa volta.

Eles são galsariah Drow, Dermot goblin, Ayo a water genasi, Maggie uma ogre gigante, ervan um humano jovem

A lança no tubarão é da moonweaver. Mas parece ter um tipo de perturbação com raios vermelhos

O mural vemos que tem um anjo. Tem à volta símbolos da moonweaver e da catha. Vemos linhas vermelhas a passar mural como se estivessem a infectar a deusa. Isto só apareceu depois de tocar no medalhão

Isto é um templo feito por elfos. Apontamos num papel (Vadania) o que está escrito em celestial para mais tarde usar o comprehend languages.

Voltamos a sair. Falamos com o kass com a alixian. Pedimos algum tempo para percebe o que se passou no templo

The light around the pedestal fades as a spectral figure in the form of a male human rises from the amulet. He is dressed in leather armor and a tattered red cape and wears a shield. His face is framed by curly brown hair and bears a melancholic expression. He pleads, “I am imprisoned. Please help me.”

Suddenly, the ground vanishes beneath your feet, and you fall, tumbling through a vortex of golden light. You fall deeper, deeper, deeper, then suddenly stop. The golden light subsides, and you find yourself suspended in a pitch-black expanse. You feel water buoying you. A vermilion light appears in the distance, illuminating the melancholy warrior, who is shackled to the ground by disgusting strands of a fleshy, crimson substance.

He raises his gaze to the heavens and, sobbing, chokes out, “Moon Weaver, I beg of you. Guide those with the power to save me to the site where first I prayed to you.” He looks around, and his eyes settle on you. “Oh, gods, there you are! My name is Alyxian. I am lost in darkness. Long ago, I prayed to the Change Bringer in the heart of a temple of evil. I beg you, take my jewel and…”

You feel consciousness leaving you, as if the pressure of the water were crushing the life out of you. Alyxian’s voice is the last thing you hear before you pass out. “Save me. Please.”

- Rivals wake the party up and introduce themselves - Moon Lancers
- Investigation of the temple and the change in the mural of Perigee the Deva changes

Galvdos moonweavers fala da biblioteca de Roxanna como a melhor da dinastia. É preciso entrar na faculdade e uma carta do Cal pode ajudar

Temos sonhos:

Kraken pensa na morte do irmão. Mas sente que a memória é alterada. Ele sente-se a afundar. O mar fica vermelho. Aparecem cristais

Tarin num casulo. Sente sofrimento, abandono e perdido. Sente que passaram anos. O casulo parte e está cheio de cristais. Fora vê uma pessoa peluda num altar. Aparecem mais quatro. Pessoa peluda toca num amuleto

Vadania sente que a vida mudou imenso. Está é a sua primeira missão.

Sonho com a minha amiga da infância a salvar de centauros na floresta

Kive é responsável por ajudar as pessoas magoada por uma entidade que o tem ajudado

Cal vê mãos de uma poça vermelha. Dessa são uma pessoa morena. E está diz para ele ajudar-nos. Ele diz para nós irmos ao cisto da deusa da mudança. Cisto é algo fora do normal.

Cal fala de que o templo negro pode ser em bazzoxan

Alguém de ankorel veio cá à procura os cristais vermelhos.

A escritura é traduzida por ele e diz: Pedigee the diva of the moonweaver

Eu e a Vadania vamos investigar da casa onde esteve a instigadora.

A investigadora deixa uma folha perdida. Tem indicado uma instituição e nome da pessoa. Prolix, investigadora e estudante da allegiance of allsight. Nota diz que veio de ankarel à procura do cristal em vários sitios. Porquê que apareceram. A língua do papel é em marquesian. Ela é uma tiefling de pele vermelha. Roupa simples.

Kraken descobre sobre o templo de Betrayer rise. Fica dentro de uma montanha. Ponto ativo de atividades demoníaca. As aurora watch têm um posto de proteção contra eles.

Responsável do outpost de bazzoxan é o comandante verin thelyss.

Betrayer:

- Asmodeus
- Bane strive emperor
- Gruunsgh ruiner o destruidor
- Loth a spider queen. Criadora dos Drow
- Farense, chain oblivion.
- teemat deusa dos dragões
- Tarog, crawling king.
- Zehir the cloaked serpent
- Vecna

  Tarin inicia ritual para recuperar memórias descobre que é um bugbear chamado tograk

  Reconhece o amigo das memórias chamado Vonn. Agora chama-se ervinn

  Investigamos formas de entrar no templo negro em bazzoxan. Só entram voluntários. O outpost não entra. Demasiado perigoso para arriscar mapear.

  Ouvimos relatos sobre uns documentos encontrados que falam de uma potencial entrada numa ponte, sobre um abismo. No fim porta com cara de uma mulher a sorrir se perfil. O cabela vai até ao pescoço e forma uma porta.

  A porra tem um símbolo redondo para colocar uma chave. Marcas de garras a tentar entrar . A imagem é da changebringer

#### Round 1

_From around [PC carrying the Jewel]’s neck the Jewel of Three Prayers begins to glow, and float a few inches in the air._

_Each of your visions grows dark, and for a single slow heartbeat you are underwater, the weight of it pressing down, crushing the breath from your lungs, a dim red light pulses in your vision. *Heartbeat noise* You’re rising through the water so fast you can’t see. Surfacing, you find yourself standing again in front of these ancient ruins, though they are unbroken and pristine towers of dark rock. Columns tower over you. The clash of steel surrounds you._

_The sky is dim, and you are surrounded by snarling creatures. You stab the spear in your hand that is not your own through a slavering demon, before spinning and slicing through the throat of a man with red eyes wild with rage, one of those twisted enough to side with the Betrayer Gods. You see one of your comrades cut down and cry out, their red blood mixing with the black ichor that slicks the stone beneath your feet. You spin and dodge, cutting and stabbing, the smell of blood and sulphur burning your nose. Looking around for a familiar flash of blue skin and gold wings, you find yourself wondering: Where is Perigee?_

_The vision fades and you are wrenched back to the present._

#### Round 2

Like coming up from a crushing weight, suddenly the Jewel flares again, and…

_A massive demon with tusks and dripping black feathers rakes its claws down your back. You barely feel it, noticing only for the time it takes to deliver a spear strike through its skull. You must find Perigee. If the embodiment of the Moon Weaver’s blessing herself cannot overcome the curse of Ruidus, what hope is there? Somehow you know that she'll be at the heart of the fray with the worst of the fighting. You charge through a clump of lesser demons, shield first, sending them to the ground, dimly aware that they are being crushed under the hooves of the bull demon goring another of your allies. Blood splatters your face, and you wipe it away with your arm. Blood and dirt and ichor mixing on your dark skin._

_A blast of radiant light cracks forth over the field before you with a thunderclap, and you can see her, Perigee, golden hair like a cloud, wings that shimmer with moonlight and a shining mace spattered in black gore. She whirls like a dervish, moving through the field of enemies like a dancer, leaving demons in her wake. A roar shakes the field, and the Demon’s commander is charging towards her. A massive black-winged demon of fire. Its whip cracks and is coiled around her forearm, burning her pale blue flesh; you can smell it from here, can feel the heat the creature gives off. Another twist and stab. You sprint towards them, trying to support her. You hear Perigee chanting a prayer to the Moon Weaver, hear the clang as she deflects a fiery sword strike, smell burning feathers. The divine light grows brighter, her voice louder; you cry out her name. But the demon delivers another strike, and Abyssal and divine fire clash and… everything goes white. You feel yourself lifted and thrown backwards, slamming into stone, ears ringing._

#### Round 3

_The gem flashes with white hot power once more,_

_You find yourselves lying in the blood-soaked dirt, ears ringing, blinking away tears. Everyone around blast radius, friend and foe alike, is char, smoldering on the ground. The demonic general is already melting into smoking, black ichor. Looking around frantically, Perigee nowhere to be found. Above, Catha shines, full and beautiful moonlight reflecting in shards of light blue crystal that trace the shockwave of the explosion._

_But Ruidus shines full and bright besides Catha, and almost seems to suck the life from your veins. Red like the blood of your companions._

_You fall to your knees. Time seems to ebb and flow. On the battlefield around you, the enemy flees and scatters, their general defeated. Your remaining allies cheer, for they have survived another day, repelled another attempt to retake Bazzoxan. But you cannot find joy, cannot breathe for the pain in your chest. And you know that you are needed elsewhere, Avandra urgently calls you to the demon’s stronghold. Like usual, there’s no time to grieve._

Players at Level 5

  - Vadania - Altar, Arcana
  - Tarin - Help with cleaning the corpses, Athletics
  - Skoot - Investigate corpses, Investigation
  - Kraken - Investigate crystals, Arcana

- Prolyx tries to investigate but doesn't find anything and decides to leave with the party
- The day is slow and they camp sooner than usual under a dead Horizonback shell
- Visions for everyone
  - Tarin - The visions hurt like they were real. You remember seeing the same angel wings, at a different angle, you felt the explosion and the bright blue crystal in the sky. You remember the feeling of panic, fear, the joy of the turn of the battle and winning the battle. Then you notice that behind you a shadow grows like something is blocking the sun and it grows and grows and _splat_. You turn at the last moment and just see an enormous figure falling towards you and everything goes black.
  - Skoot - Flying with Yumi is normal for you, now she is back but it still hurts and it was difficult now having her around for the short while it was. And you know and understand that her sacrifice saved you all. You were not paying attention and you were just having a vision of flying around, but suddenly you notice that you are approaching a city of red rock and tall black spires, you see Bazzoxan beneath you and approaching a black temple. Your vision becomes third-person and you see a white dove flying, approaching and entering the doors of the temple
  - Kive - You see a monster in front of you, hollow eyes and black tears running down its face, you hear a soft and quiet crying it was constantly making. You feel the loneliness, solitude, sadness, abandonment, betrayal, rage, anger… Revenge!! All of those that betrayed you will get what they deserve. You hate them and you know you are just for it but magically you feel a connection, a bound to those that wronged you and you feel reflected back a burning hatred, anger so strong that almost scares you. You feel that somewhere out there someone hates you more that you hate them.
  - Kraken - (Raspy Voice) Finally a worthy shrimp rises from the sea foam and proves is life was not wasted. I like the direction you are following and I hope you bring me more knowledge of these red crystals, I like what they are capable of doing. Follow my will or drown.
  - Vadania - Your fingers still hurt, whenever you use your unknown power in the bow you don’t need to pull the string but the energy still burns. You used the power so many times in the battle and you look at your red marks, you examine and it doesn't hurt but it feels so alien and unknown. You don’t understand why your patron gave you this gift or curse. You feel confident in your skills but you still have to learn more. Tristan is out there and he was in Bazzoxan recently and was some of the last places someone saw him.
- Next day travel they find a green knight praying at a tree (resolves in quick combat and nothing else)
- Next day travel goes well with good weather, not much added
- At night perceptions are very very bad, ambush by a Gloomstalker, remember no armour

- He tells the party that he lived in the Greying Wildlands in a small village called Hollow Brook and because it is very far, very few people are from there in these parts; except a boy, a couple of years back, Tristan arrived in Bazzoxan about 7 years ago and was very dedicated and hard-working.
- Tristan went away one day saying that he had some business with friends from his past and never “returned”, Fogao believes that he just moved with his friends, no one chooses to stay in a town infested with demons.
- Vadania was very interested in this information and asked some questions and more information. They learned that there is a small “black market” outside of the city that helps people move and sometimes get items that are harder to get inside the city (nothing illegal necessarily)

He prays all night, we see the moons crossing the sky and in the morning a group of 4 figures appear and joining him, and together leave the space

You see a young human, curls plastered to his brow by sweat, sinking to his knees in the garden. His eyes betray a lack of sleep, and despite the softness of his features, he looks like he has experienced more pain than any one person should bear. “They’re counting on me,” he whispers. “They need me, but I’m exhausted and frightened. What do I do? Please. Someone tell me—what do I do?”

The moons race across the sky, soon replaced by the angry red sun that rises before a fateful battle. Five silhouettes approach the temple, and one claps the kneeling figure on the back. Their voices are muffled, as if coming at you through water, but you see them embrace, standing strong, before marching off to war.

- The fact that the party when unconscious is concerning and Fogao says that history sometimes is stronger than people give it credit and some events could trigger magic to happen in “charged” places (Party remembers the fight at the temple)
- They show him the Jewel and even though he doesn’t recognise it, he can tell that the item has divine power from 3 different sources and one of them is very similar to what he felt the other day. The item must be related to something in this land
- They decide to go and see the quest that Prolyx had with a special magical item, on the way they pass a small procession with 4 guards and a casket for a higher ranking officer, an old tradition, inefficient but with some meaning for the guards in question
- At the crematorium, they see a cart with several corpses wrapped in white tunic and being “loaded” in special drawers that will be inserted in the crematorium itself.
- They meet the brothers that run the place, one more talkative and another one, more muscular, quiet and missing an arm. The two men are Reynard, a chaotic good scout, and his bigger, older brother, Sebastian.
- Prolyx is interested in a pile of corpses that is being left on the side and the job is to cremate them and get rid of a dead Vroc (that unnaturally is not melting) that is in the pile. She believes the demon must have something inside that is keeping it “fresh”. The party sees something under the skin of the monster
- After an amazing skill success, Tarin is by himself taking care of the corpses and Kraken goes full doctor trying to open the creature without bursting any poison nodules.
- They were able to extract a small shiny stone and a very intricate box that almost seemed to have gears and small moving pieces, completely locked without any type of lid or opening. Upon the removal of the box, the creature starts to melt away and back into the dirt.
- Guards look a bit confused but Vadania tells Kraken to hide away the “loot” inside the bag.

- They see a Fall Eladrin with strangely large and long fingers, a small spiral horn on her head and very large black pupils
- Question talks about mythic resonance, the effect of the past on the present and the actions of people who repeat the past without knowing.
- Question is a bit vague in some topics and very specific in other topics.
- She has been in Bazzoxan for the last 2 months and was to meet with a delegation of the Cobalt Soul that after visiting Tenerys went to Betrayers Rise without her.
- A half-orc stands up and is about to leave when it is interrupted by another patron of the bar, an arakroka who pushes the person to the centre of the bar.

- After that, Question is still interested in sharing her art she shows a perfect picture of the island where the party found the Jewel of Three Prayers, taken from a diary of a pre-divergence explorer.
- The next drawing is of an artefact called Jewel of Three Prayers, thought to have been lost centuries ago. The image was inspired by several frescos from around the time of the Calamity.
- The party recognise the drawing and shows the artefact to Question, who is amazed at how similar it is to the drawing and how it must be the real deal and the artefact exists.
- The next one is a drawing of a rubbing done on a door inside the Betrayers Rise, she saw this inside the house of Tenarys. Next to the symbol of the door, there is a small circular depression with the shape and size of the Jewel as the party knows it
- The party asks for more and Question shows a picture of a cat 😸

- While at the bar they go and talk with Ayo while she is at the bar. Vadania and Tarin.
- They try to understand if Ardosia can be trusted and Ayo seems to be in a business-only relationship, where she has given them a couple of jobs in the last days because they arrived a short time ago. She knows that Ardosia has contacts and other business but that is not their issue.
- They show a picture of the Key for the Gates and Ayo seems to recognize it from something Ardosia might have talked about but never seen it. She also never heard the name Tenarys.
- She shows her new spear from an adventure loot and when she moves the armour shifts and Vadania notices red veins in her shoulders.
- They decide to leave and head to the out-of-town market. It is a desolate trip through the edge of the Barbed Fields and as it starts to get dark there is almost no noise and even being careful they don’t see anyone else following them.
- As they arrive, they see a warehouse, with heavy reinforced metal doors. They prepare to take a watch for a few hours to see how safe it is. After a few hours with no action, the party executes a plan.
- The party splits. Skoot and Vadania will cast invisibility and go to the top floor and wait by the second door. The rest, Kraken, Tarin and Kive will go to the main door.
- They know on the door and a figure opens a slit to inspect who approaches. He asks what and who they are.

- They don’t like very much the deal they are getting and Kive takes the vial and throws it open to the merchant
- Combat starts!

Upstairs

- Invisibly they wait for any signal or noise. When the big door closes Skoot starts lock-picking the door.
- They are very quiet and open a door for Vadania to peek at because Skoot is mostly blind in the dark.
- Vadania sees a person on the top floor, observing but doesn't notice them.
- They enter, close the door and get ready for what is going on, they try to get closer to where the rest of the party is.
- With this, Vadania notices that another person is on the ceiling waiting to ambush the party in case anything goes wrong.

## 20240206 - Session 27

Players at Level 5

- Kraken uses identify on the Vials
- Zeal: When drunk or applied to the skin as an action, the user of zeal must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, becoming paralyzed for 1d4 rounds on a failed save as their muscles seize up. On a success, the user's weapon attacks deal 1d6 additional damage for one minute. After this time, the user gains one level of exhaustion, regardless of the saving throw result.
- On the upper floor the team, mostly Tarin cuts a leg and a hand and after doing it the figure re-emerges back in the coffin.
- Vadania sends a message to whoever is on the other side of the organization, sending the head of one of the people in the warehouse sending it via the magical chest used for communications that she found.
- Vadania tries to look at the documentation and finds some notes on procedures and services offered in this place and understands that the magical chest is the way in and out for items and money. This place is only a remote storage place because it is far away from most authorities that might raid it
- They decide to carry the coffin, wrap him in tents and a carpet, and improvise a small cart to carry it back to town.
- As they arrive at the gates they ask the guards to call Verin while they head for the Wall of the Unforgotten to talk to the priest there

- They knock him down at the same time the effect of the Vampire wears off
- They investigate the space and see that the chimney is broken and Tarin after being healed says that the Vampire turned into a bat and flew out of the hole in the wall
- Yumi flies out and finds a recently destroyed cave entrance, about 500ft up the face of the mountain where the warehouse sits against
- They decide that the best course of action is to rest and keep watch in case of attack. They destroy the coffin and burn the pieces during the afternoon/night
- Vadania tries the Amulet of Health and gets chocked until someone removes the item
- They return to town at night stealthily and try to guide the party members who see poorly in the dark
- They pass by some awake some very sleepy guards and go to the Ready Room for a night's rest
- They test several magical items, mostly the Amulet of Health and how to best identify curses and items. There is a lot of talk and it ends with uncertainty. Kraken knows that he never identified anything as a curse but the Amulet doesn't do the same as the magical effect identified on it.
- In the morning there is a small shopping spree, with a lot of items sold and bought, a minor and a Greater healing potion
- They visit Bautha and after showing the state of Vadania and Kive she agrees to give them the scroll on the condition that they pay for the spell materials (100gp of gold dust). Kraken is able to cast Greater Restoration, with visual results, the red spikes and crystals on Vadania’s arms reduce and disappear back in the boils and red veins.
- As the group is about to leave they spot the Moon Lancers and with a bit of conversing and persuasion, they recruit them to come to the Gates and enter Betrayers Rise together.
- They arrive at the gates and are stopped by a General who seems confused about why so many people are approaching the gates. The party explains who they are and their quest to try and stop the demonic incursions on the city.
- With ImprovHobos reputation and well-placed words they are given passage to investigate the gate and set up in case of anything comes from inside.
- Skoot finds a spot on a wall that seems to contain the form for the key they have. Kraken inserts the “egg” and rotates. The opening quickly closes while the earth sounds like it splitting and at an amazing speed the gates “open”. The wall just disappeared into itself leaving a massing 50ftf/60ft hole on the wall.
- From inside two creatures rush out and Combat Starts!
- From ready actions, we get some hits including from one of the Arcane Cannons

## Luis Notes 29

- The party is ready and the whole group begins the fight against a ‣ and a Deaths Kiss
- Kive is able to stop the Behir with his Channel Divinity so the whole group focus on the Deaths Kiss
- Between running and some ranged attacks the two parties are able to kill the Deaths Kiss and enter the temple before the doors close
- But right as the doors are closing the Behir, free from the immobility still gets an attack on Kive
- With all the panic and taking in the new area they are in the party finds a barrier/protection entering the main way into the temple, into the Entrance, at the start of a long bridge surrounded by chasms and grey mist (R1)
- The Moon Lancers all go through with success but ImprovHobos have some trouble, from the other side of the barrier they see Question falling into the abyss and Kraken, the horse and Kive almost follow but the team saves them
- After the bridge, they find a door they saw in Question drawings and on Tenarys notes and notice that there is a gap where the amulet could fit

- Level up to Level 6 and some items gain some new properties
- They enter the Room of First Knight, a large statue of a horned devil with a giant mace in his hands resting at his feet, and a fountain with sparkling water all around. The party avoids looking into the water and interacting and decides to take the door right across the entrance (K1)
- They enter a long cavern. This hall is cavernous, loftier and far longer than the one which you have left. You were near its southern end, northward it ran away into darkness. Down the centre stalked a double line of towering pillars. They were carved like boles of mighty trees whose boughs upheld the roof with a branching tracery of stone. Their stems were smooth and black, but a red glow was darkly mirrored on their sides. Tentatively traversing the immense hall, stopping periodically to investigate bones and debris scattered at the pillars' roots. You pass the remains of rotting corpses and crumbling skeletons in their chitinous armour, both long dead and recently slain alike. The tell-tale signs of skirmishes and fighting retreats. (E1)
- They enter the Vestibule. This chamber is empty except for a skull-shaped vase on a small, semicircular table resting against the back wall of an alcove in the north wall. Six narrower alcoves line the east and west walls. The northeast alcove seems to have once led to a hallway, but it has caved in. (R3).
- With a combination of Comprehend Languages to read several phrases in the room and quick thinking from Skoot he donates a carved dagger from home and deposits it in the skull vase, burning and decaying until it is dust and broken, with this the wall behind the vase opens.
- They progress and enter a room, squared with the ceiling full of gross black and brown matter and from inside 3 Chasmes start to emerge buzzing and ready to attack (C1)

## Luis Notes 30

Players at Level 6

- The session begins with the fight against 3 Chasmes, Kraken very fast entangles 2 of them inside their own nest, they kill the one that gets closer to the ground and seeing Yumi being affected by the buzzing they run and close the door behind them.
- They run and enter the Dungeon Stronghold. Venturing into the depths of the dungeon the party finds themselves immersed in an expansive dungeon stronghold, a warren of chambers and passages. Creeping through the corridors, hiding from view, pausing at every junction for the sound of inhabitants and patrols, poised to flee. Ritual rooms full of worshipping fiends; barracks teeming with corrupted orcs; chained monstrous aberrations in fiery dens. You sneak through, with the weight of odds weighing against you past each chamber skirted, each passage taken, each encounter dodged. Resting in hidden alcoves while groups of monstrous warriors patrol by. Eventually, the noises and activity subside, as you delve deeper and reach a more secluded district of the mega-dungeon, in an empty room the party takes a short rest before continuing. (E2)
- ImprovHobos enter the Basilica of Revelry, two rows of black stone pillars marbled with white veins support the vaulted ceiling of this hall, the floor of which is polished to a mirror-like sheen. Ornate brass braziers rest at the feet of four of the pillars, and faint music fills the hall. The four braziers ignite, their bowls filling with pale flames that coalesce into dancing, humanoid forms. The glow from the flames glints off the north wall, where a towering mosaic of stained glass depicts a maelstrom of colour, within which are nine symbols. The image shifts even as you stare at it. (R9)
- While investigating the room and exploring, Vadania and Skoot attack the stained glass breaking it. This curses most of the party and starts combat with the flames.
- They decide that the best way of solving this is to invoke the help of the Moonweaver to try and rest and cure the curse affecting the party. They cure 3 curses, which is the exact number of cursed party members
- Without any other way of leaving they move to the next room, a side door full of webs. They enter the Spiders’ Chancel, a haunting song that echoes through this half-collapsed chamber, interspersed with a clicking sound that seems to reverberate in your bones. Thick spiderwebs, giving off a pale green glow, stretch from floor to ceiling. (R8)
- They start burning the webs and notice two giant spiders in the corners of the room, they move in a row, ready for anything and a volley of arrows attack the front row party members, 2 Driders show up and confront the team

## Lus Notes 31

Players at Level 6

- Vadania starts the initiative by trying to negotiate with the Driders
- Passage through the nest is declined but in exchange for peace and an Amulet of Health (cursed?), the Driders give the party some knowledge from a secret room.
- Kive investigates and finds much information on the Betrayer Gods, curses, rituals and prayers. And notices a pattern and finds a prayer that unites the books.
- “First praise be to the Spider Queen, whose kingdom was forsaken. Next, exult the Ruiner, whose spear shook the green earth. In turn, pay homage to Oblivion and the ending of all things. And last, I give myself to the Crawling King.”
- They go back to stained glass and while Kive recites the prayer Vadania’s Mage Hand touches the correct symbols on the glass. A door next to the glass opens to allow the party through
- They travel through the Catacombs of Torment. Entering through the broken stone wall, the air turns stale and the temperature drops. Your foreign feet in this deserted chamber kicks fine black dust into the air, like ash. All around you see rows of onyx-black stone shelfs laid into the walls lined with dust-laden skulls of twisted and malformed shapes. Mutated, aberrant skeletons laid to rest on the stone slab. All adorned by undying candles at their perpetual wick's end. The chamber extends, turns and twists into a maze of glistening-black stone tombs, vaults and crypts: chambers filled floor to ceiling with bone and corpse callously discarded in piles; tall-ceiling crypts with ornate tombs defended by fiendish wights; walls made entirely of layered bone and thousands of broken skulls, mummified faces capture their excruciating deaths. (E8)
- Arriving at the Supplicant Pit they scout first with Yumi and see that the walls of this hallway are decorated with carvings of supine figures and chained bodies. The floor is covered by a nest of black chains. they pass with confidence, Skoot and Horse fall to the heavy presence and Horse is getting dragged and chained. Kive releases the horse by cancelling the spell and Skoot gets free and carried to the other side of the room. (R10)
- They arrive at the Temple of Umberlee, rising from the floor of this damp, dark cave is a grotesque, ten-foot-tall statue of a sea monster with glistening eyes and tentacles. A raised stone basin, its base carved to resemble a surging wave, stands nearby. Against the walls are two smashed crates, two clay urns, and three rotted wooden chests. Clinging to the ceiling behind the statue is a nine-foot-long slug with glistening black skin and tentacles sprouting from its head. It opens its mouth, revealing sharp teeth. (K5)
- Kraken casts Create Water and makes it rain inside the room, at the same time he shows respect and asks to enter the room. Vadania and Skoot follow and they do a small communion with the statue. They loot the room, they find some coins, two healing potions, a Driftglobe and a coral crown. They try to communicate with the Slug but without much success, they see that there are some shadows behind the statue waiting but inactive. The party takes a short rest here.
- They move forward and arrive at a room full of blood, Blood Font of the Ruiner. This chamber has a flat, fifty-foot-high ceiling, and its black stone walls are covered with deep gouges and lined with alcoves to the east and west. In the middle of the area is a circular pool filled to the brim with blood. Standing in the pool is a seven-foot-tall orc, pouring blood from a golden bowl over his head. The creatures snarl and turn to you, he takes a dagger and cuts his neck and the room closes and starts to fill with boiling blood. (R14)
- Kraken was ready because they had read about this room back in Jigow. he casts Water Walking on everyone but Vadania
- With a very high perception, Tarin notices that there are various ways of leaving the room, through a giant hole in a wall that seems an open mouth, a gap on a wall or a gap near the ceiling. They decide to rush the gap near the ceiling and have to crawl through a tight space for some time until arriving at a new area.
- With a high perception from Tarin, they decide to leave the room by a hole in the left wall.
- They enter the Sea of Souls, after crawling through the tight crawlspace, the party emerges into a huge cavernous expanse, positioned on a high rocky platform above an immense drop into the darkness below. They see the landscape ahead, a vast subterranean complex of rocky pillars and platforms connected by derelict rope bridges that stretch for miles. Below, a sea of mist, darkness, and shadow framed in a cold blue light, that swirls and laps around the rocky spires like waves and belies the deadly drop beneath. Traversing the expanse, hugging the cold broken rock, and crossing each bridge with trepidation. The timber creaks and snaps under your weight, and the threadbare rope strains and groans. Hour after hour of crossing and hesitant rest, staring into the swirling darkness below, you all start to make out the chilling form of osseous and corporeal bodies silhouetted in the dark blue glow. Long drawn skeletal faces and dead eyes. Arms outstretched, beckoning, calling to collect you. Grasping at your feet as you span each bridge. Weary and mentally exhausted, you finally reach a great overhanging rock terrace, and the first doorway you have seen for some time. (E4)
- But between the door and the party, there is a creature, massive, red, and full of armour but it seems to be sleeping or at least resting, laying, on a small island on the right side of the road they have to travel (C8)
- As they begin, Kive casts Channel Divinity to try and lock in the creature before it notices them.

## 20240313 - Session 32

Players at Level 6

- The session begins with the big roll, the enemy fails the save on the spell and awakes and can’t move
- But the creature can still do ranged attacks so he summons a massive fire wall to try and stop the party.
- The party does some tricks to get by the monster, Vadania gets a bit too close but escapes, only after taking some damage.
- Just as they are crossing the door Skoot throws a dagger at the monster releasing him from Kive’s spell.
- The Balor rushes the wall and attacks, causing massive damage to the wall and door and everyone on the other side, the damage blocked the previous passage and sent everyone flying, Tarin and Kraken being closer to the wall take more damage and Kraken even get stuck below some rubble.
- The party extracts Kraken and takes a few minutes to do some heals before continuing.
- They continue the journey and navigate a network of 5-foot-wide, 10-foot-high tunnels zigzags in incomprehensible directions (E6)
- They take advantage of Vadania Magical Vision to navigate the labyrinth through multiple twists and turns and upside-down walkways and even turn back on one of the corridors and reach the exit (R13)
- They arrive at a large rectangular room with a green laser going down the middle. This large echoing room is lit by a beam of acidic green fire that extends from the eye of a horrific statue along the east wall. Four triangular pillars with mirrors on one face reflect the beam at right angles. (K4)
- They investigate and find an angel statue on the opposite wall of the room. They do some experiments, exploding an acid crystal that was in the room, leaving Tarin a bit worse than before but are able to redirect the laser using several mirrors to open the door to leave the room.
- After walking another corridor they arrive at Threshold of the Excoriated. The awful wailing noise gets even louder as you approach this chamber. A beam of light from above illuminates a statue in the middle of the room. The statue, made of pale marble, is shaped like a man on his knees, arms pinioned behind his back, trussed up in chains that cut into his skin. Hooks line the corners of the figure’s mouth, pulling his lips away from his teeth, and smaller barbs encircle his eyes, holding the eyelids open. All the while, hideous noise comes out of the statue’s open mouth—yet still, its expression is one of ecstasy. A double door made of iron is set into the statue’s chest; these surfaces have no handles. A triangle, each side forty feet long, is carved into the floor around the statue, surrounding it. At each of the triangle’s points, a stone arm juts up from the floor with its hand outstretched. (R13)
- Strangely there is a figure sitting on the ground, maybe meditating, a green Eladrin.
- They meet Lilo, an explorer from Alkmaar University, she seems a bit confused about how she got inside the temple or how long, but she thinks it was only a couple of hours
- She knows a lot of people from the village where Skoot lives, but it seems that they don’t know the same people. Even Uvis, someone that Skoot considers older than him, Lilo remembers as a kid. She says some names, including the name of her mother, Diadne Blueemoon and some Eladrin, Vimmas (F), Halas (M), Lena (F), Saffo (M) and an elf Dinan Twiceborne. But Skoot is a bit lost and processing who this person could be.
- She remembers that Alkmaar is just a medium-sized, smallish school instead of the University that Skoot knows.
- While still thinking about this but trying to progress they get close to the statue they feel an invading presence and some succeed and some fail.
- Skoot seems to fail more often than expected and starts attacking the party while the rest focus on destroying 3 wards around the statue and the door opens up with some stairs descending from the belly of the statue. Skoot eventually is able to break free of the effect as well
- The party goes in and descends stairs that seem to defy the real space and go through the statue. They arrive at a big open room, almost as a prayer room or part of a church. With a beautiful tile floor, lots of torches and a pleasant almost atmosphere.
- They see several tables with items, maps, books, scrolls and lots of information, the necklace begins to pulse and they feel a feeling that this is it, they see a lot of info that could help them in their future quests. They see books that could help them find the Library of Ancient Knowledge, and they see maps that could lead to the Utallot hiding spots, they see records of families from the Dynasty, books about religion and information about Gods and their power, they see notes and drawings of people and where to find them.
